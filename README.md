# WeatherApp

This is a simple weather's app that uses Weather Underground API to fetch weather data, and displays that in a well organised way. This app is hosted on the firebase hosting. It also uses basic authentication.

## Steps to start working with your local app

- clone the repo
- run `ng serve --open` to serve the app and open in your default browser
- then work with the app
- also you need to get an API Key from the API of your choice

Make sure you have node installed

## Important Note

Since the deployment of this app, the way Underground Weather API handles requests has changed, therefore this app is no longer working.
